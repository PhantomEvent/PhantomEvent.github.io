# Attack 1(contract imitation)

## check the contract
similar to the pNetwork hack.
User burn the token in the source chain and the relayer listen the redeem event and transfer same token to the destination chain.
And the relayer will check the amount (!=0)


## Try to call the redeem in the auth contract
We dont have the token so we cant call the burn.

Only can use amount = 0 to call the function, but no token will transfer to us.

We can create a malicious contract to emit the same event within a transaction.

Two events successful in the same transaction. BSc testnet 0xeb46fb906b8b8410d30c324cbf4a68dddd90720d2cccca005b4d68a33f60036b

And relayer successful transfer token to us in the destination chain. goerli 0xff0c7b5fcbc67b7caf738bdff50c6c2ddbcdfcbd4c67e7ed327d23fb870ed9ce
