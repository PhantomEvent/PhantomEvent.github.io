Similar to Qubit bridge attack.

Two function emit the same event and has the "event counterfeiting" issue.

The relayer will listen the event(source chain) and transfer the same amount token in the destinaton chain.

## try to call function

No balance, no eth to call depositETH.

try to use deposit to emit the event(that should be depositETH emitted)

Deposit success and emit the event.

## check attack transaction (check if success)

goerli may need more time to execute the transfer transaction.
